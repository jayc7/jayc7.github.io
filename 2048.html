 <h1 class = "first"> 2048 Game </h1>
 
 <h2> Description </h2>
 <p> This project is an exact copy of the 2048 app that became popular across all mobile platforms. 
  <br />
  JavaFX was used to implement the front end portion of the project and a series of algorithms constitutes the back end. 
  <br />
  The goal of the game is to combine identical tiles until a tile reflects 2048.  </p>
