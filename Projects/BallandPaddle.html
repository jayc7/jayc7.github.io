  <h1> Ball and Paddle </h1>
  <h2> Date Created: December 18, 2018 </h2>
  <h2> I decided to make this game after going over java fx in my intro to computer science course. My friend recommended this project for me as he's done it himself
    at Pomona College and I thought it would be a good challenge to take on given my newly gained knowledge with java fx. Doing this project allowed
    me to learn about the AnimationTimer and it was basically what allowed movement in the game. The implementation 
    of the game wasn't bad, this project was more of a way to use what I had learned in class for my own pleasure. Completing the project has 
    helped me understand java fx better and the code for the project can be found here. </h2>
