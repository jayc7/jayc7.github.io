 <h2> Description </h2>
 <div class = "description-container">
 <p> Project TwoNote is a note taking web app my good friend and I decided to build in the summer of 2018. In the process of doing so, we learned Python,the PyGobject API and how to adapt to using a toolkit in order to implement the apps GUI.
 Our inspiration for making the app is the lack of good note taking apps Linux has to offer. The application uses a design thats intuitive, convenient, and subscribes to . 
 Our goal for this app is to make it the staple of Linux users productivity applications. </p>
