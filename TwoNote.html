 <h1 class = "first"> Project TwoNote </h1>
 
 <h2> Description </h2>
 <p> Project TwoNote is a note taking web app my good friend and I decided to build in the summer of 2018. In the process of doing so, we learned how to 
  use the PyGobject API 
  <br />
  JavaFX was used to implement the front end portion of the project and a series of algorithms constitutes the back end. 
  <br />
  The goal of the game is to combine identical tiles until a tile reflects 2048.  </p>

 <p> Team: Jason Cabrera, Jorge Aparicio </p>
 <p> Language: Python/PyGobject </p>
