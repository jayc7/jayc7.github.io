 <h2> Description </h2>
 <p> Project TwoNote is a note taking web app my good friend and I decided to build in the summer of 2018. In the process of doing so, we learned python,how to 
  use the PyGobject API and adapted to using a toolkit in order to implement the apps GUI. Our inspiration for making the app is the lack of good note taking apps Linux has to offer. 
  <br />
  <h2> The application uses a design thats intuitive, convenient, and subscribes to . Our goal for this app is to make it the staple of Linux users productivity applications.
