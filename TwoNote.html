 <h2> Description </h2>
 <div class = "description-container">
 <p> Project TwoNote is a note taking web app my good friend and I decided to build in the summer of 2018. In the process of doing so, we learned Python, the PyGobject API and how to adapt to using a toolkit in order to implement the apps GUI.
 Our inspiration for making the app is the lack of good note taking apps Linux has to offer. The application uses a design thats intuitive, convenient, and subscribes to the native GTK design language. 
 Our goal for this app is to make it the staple of Linux users productivity applications. </p>
  
  <p> A huge challenge for us was getting through the learning curve that comes with learning an API along with learning how python works. Out of all the components, the sidebar menu was the most time consuming 
  to implement. With that being said, I'm proud of the progress we've made and I look forward to adding more features such as google drive backup, a drawing area for handwritten notes, and overall optimizing the client's experience. </p>
